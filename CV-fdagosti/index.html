					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Around the Software industry for more than 14 years, highly experienced into innovation management, agile methodologies and teamwork.</p>

<p>I bring a Lean Product oriented approach to companies. I focus on the true value we are bringing to customers.</p>

<p>I focus on value proposition at all levels. Problems worth solving can be financial or business oriented, but also organizationally, preventing an organization to scale.</p>

<p>I also organize large engineering groups into efficient small productive units that have their own purpose. Less is more, creating highly efficient small products is key to innovation and scalability. Organizing a product like self contained startup is key to innovation</p>

<p>Finally, I iterate a lot. I replace heavy planning bureaucracy by an ability to assess the strategy direction through experiments, demonstration and feedback loops. The best status report is the demonstration of a workable product to stakeholders.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell:
<ul>
<li> I reduce costs by optimizing and clarifying people’s mission</li>
<li> I scale product development from 200 people « blob » to a collection of small products interacting with each others</li>
<li> I reduce the need for corporate bureaucracy and focus on value provided to customers</li>
<li> I bring the good practices of B2C to B2B markets where the user is often not the person paying for the product</li>
    </ul>
                    </p>

<p>I am an architect, a product manager, a development leader, a logistician, all embedded in one<br>

My field is video, IPTV, User experience, embedded and mobile platforms, Cloud with OpenStack, B2B businesses...<br>

I have a wide technical background that makes me quite adaptable to a lot of environments and engagements.</p>
