    This is a prototype of a video based application used in Set Top Boxes. It is built on Angular 2 with minimal external libararies.
    The goal is to mimic a "leanback" experience which is a very different experience from a classic website. 
    As an example, the video is always run full screen in the background. This application does not use responsiveness as it is not made to run on a desktop.
    Most of the animations are done using CSS transforms. The whole sizing dimension is inspired from the Youtube TV app.
    At the root level, it uses a "vw" font size that will set it propoertional to the window size.
    Then, all dimensions are expressed in "em"s so that everything scales up when window is resized.
    This has the benefits of having the app working on any resolution and aspect ratio (Full HD, HD, 4K, 16/9, 4/3...)

    This is a website done for teachers in schools. It allows teachers to create riddles, quizzes and other questions using a rich editor
    and create "challenges" for the students to answer those questions. 
    Typical challenges are done during a week or even a full year, where students get a new quizz every week.
    Students get points by answering correctly the quizzes and are getting a leaderboard to compare with each other.
    Teachers can create challenges in advance and have the challenges unfold automatically, week after week or day after day.
    Finally, teachers get some data on who answered when and accurately or not. This allows Teachers to understand their students' problems
